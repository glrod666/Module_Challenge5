In our analysis, we focused on the effects of various drugs on tumor volume, notably Capomulin, Ramicane, Infubinol, Ceftamin, and Propriva. The bulk of our subjects were administered either Capomulin or Ramicane, both of which demonstrated significant impacts on tumor volume. It is noteworthy that Infubinol was the sole drug among those analyzed to present an outlier in our data set, suggesting unique interactions worth further investigation.

Comparatively, Capomulin exhibited a smaller variance in final tumor volume, implying a more consistent and potentially more reliable effect on tumor reduction. Conversely, Ceftamin displayed a larger variance in final tumor volume, indicating less predictability in its efficacy. Propriva was identified as the least frequently used drug within our study, which may reflect its effectiveness, availability, or other factors not covered in this analysis.

Our study also maintained a balanced distribution between male and female subjects, ensuring gender did not skew the results. This gender parity is crucial for the generalizability of our findings across both sexes.

I used assisant from the course examples and problems and assistance from Xpert Learning.
